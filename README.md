# TwoLayers_Neural_Network
In this respitory, we implement two layers neural network for some Mathematical functions using Sigmoid and ReLu activation function which are defined separatedly in two different colab notebook
Credit to the implementtion for the code Two Layers Net using ReLu activaton is from the CS231N course of Standford
